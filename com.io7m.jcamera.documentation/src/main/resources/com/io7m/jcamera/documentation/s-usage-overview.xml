      This section attempts to describe how to use the
      <Term type="package">${project.parent.name}</Term>
      package. The example code uses
      <LinkExternal target="http://jogamp.org/jogl/www">JOGL</LinkExternal>
      but the package can obviously be used under any Java input/windowing system. This section doesn't attempt to
      explain why anything works the way it does: Readers are encouraged to read the
      <Link target="2f0335ba-e008-431f-b8f1-4ff6e477f573">design and implementation</Link>
      section, which describes everything in extensive detail.
