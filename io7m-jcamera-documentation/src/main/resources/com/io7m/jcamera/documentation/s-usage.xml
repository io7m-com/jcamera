      This section attempts to describe how to use the
      <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term> package. The
      example code uses <s:link-external s:target="http://jogamp.org/jogl/www">JOGL</s:link-external>
      but the package can obviously be used under any Java input/windowing system.
      This section doesn't attempt to explain why anything works the way it does -
      readers are encouraged to read the
      <s:link s:target="dai">design and implementation</s:link> section, which
      describes everything in extensive detail.
    </s:paragraph>
    <s:paragraph>
      A complete listing of all example source files is available
      at the <s:link s:target="usage.files">end of the section</s:link>.
